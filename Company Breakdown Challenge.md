> 📌 Problems to Tackle:
> - [Visualize the yearly breakdown of male and female employees in the company since 1990]()
> - [Analyze male and female managers across departments each year, starting from 1990](https://github.com/punyarani/exercise/edit/main/README.md#problem-1)
> - [Compare average salaries for male and female employees up to 2002, with department-specific filtering](#problem-3)
> - [Design an SQL stored procedure for average gender-based salaries per department within user-defined salary ranges](#problem-4)
> - [Visualize the outcome using Tableau](#problem-5)

## Problem 1
Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

## Problem 2
Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

## Problem 3 (#problem-3)
Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.

## Problem 4 (#problem-4)
Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.

## Problem 5 (#problem-5)
Visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau.
